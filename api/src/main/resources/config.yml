# since redis can support ssl by version 6 you can use SSL/TLS in redis bungee too!

# You can set Environment variable 'REDISBUNGEE_PROXY_ID' to override

# Allowed values: FIRST, NORMAL, LAST
# This option enables RedisBungee to manage various interactions between other plugins and the online player count,
